# tebgui
a gui wrapper around tor to use it as a proxy (ish)

rn this is very early in development and absolutely sucks. It works pretty well but there's no error handling and stuff.

**linux users**: note that this might not work, and it won't set the proxy by default. you'll have to do your own stuff to configure it on your system.
