# tebgui
a gui wrapper around tor to use it as a proxy (ish)<br>
rn this is very early in development and absolutely sucks. It works pretty well but there's no error handling and stuff.<br>
**linux users**: note that this might not work, and it won't set the proxy by default. you'll have to set it up yourself.
